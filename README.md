This project was actually heavily inspired by a fellow classmate who created something similar for his .NET studying and I wanted to do something similar for Java. Using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend, I created an app where the user can choose to have random flashcards to cycle through or chose "Study Mode". "Study Mode" allows a user to cycle through questions and mark whether or not they got the question right. When the user opts to exit, the user is shown a list of all of the questions that they got incorrect so that they know what they need to continue studying. There's also an option for the user to really put their knowledge to the test with a quiz.

**What I Learned:**
This project is great because I continue to learn from it even after completing it. Not only was it a great solo learning experience where I learned things like how to pull random data from a database and how to make quizzes, but I still go back to it to study. I can also easily add new questions to study as I continue to learn new things..
